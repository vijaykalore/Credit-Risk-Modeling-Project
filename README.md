# Credit-Risk-Modeling-Project
The Credit Risk Modeling project leverages classification techniques to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their loans. By analyzing a range of variables including credit history, income levels, loan amounts, and repayment behavior, the model categorizes borrowers into different risk levels.

Key Features:
Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Thorough cleaning and preparation of data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features that improve model performance and predictive accuracy.

Model Training and Evaluation: Training various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, and evaluating them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Insights and Recommendations: Providing actionable insights and recommendations based on model outcomes to help financial institutions make informed lending decisions and manage credit risk effectively.
